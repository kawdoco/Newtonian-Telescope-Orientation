 #  🔭 Newtonian Telescope Moving Project
This project is focused on designing and building a motorized moving system for a Newtonian reflector telescope. The goal is to provide precise, smooth, and automated movement of the telescope to track celestial objects across the night sky.

	🧭 Tracking System – Automated tracking of stars and planets using 
 		calculated celestial coordinates.
	🎛️ Motor Control with 3D Telescope – Stepper/servo motors for 
 		accurate positioning and smooth movement.
	💻 Software Integration – Control via 3D Animations (e.g.,Python) 
 		with user-friendly commands.
	🌌 Astronomy Focused – Optimized for Newtonian reflector telescopes, 
 		balancing portability, accuracy, and ease of use.
